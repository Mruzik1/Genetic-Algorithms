# Genetic Algorithms
Solving Traveling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithms to show how it actually works. Below are some descriptions of different types of mutations and crossovers.
Also I performed a few experiments applying different crossovers, mutations and variety of parameters while solving the TSP.

## Crossover Examples
Crossover is one of the most important things in Genetic Algorithms. This part of GA itself could be considered as a "evolution performer". There are several examples of crossovers with a portion of pseudocode and the pictures illustrating the process.

### Single-Point Crossover

### Multi-Point Crossover
One of the common crossover types is Multi-Point Crossover or N-Point Crossover. <br /><br />
