# Genetic-Algorithms
Implementing some tasks using genetic algorithms for TUKE

# To-Do List
1) Learn about genetic algorithms basics
2) Choice a problem to solve using a few genetic algorithms
3) Write several scripts in ``Python`` (probably with ``matplotlib`` and ``numpy``)
4) Perform some tests and experiments with the scripts by giving them different data
5) Write a ``preudo-code`` of those algorithms with short notes on differences between them
6) Make a report about our work:
   - Our problem's description
   - Which problems we can solve using each of the algorithms with a most optimal outcome
   - Our outcome's analysis
